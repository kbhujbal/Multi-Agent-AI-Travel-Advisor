You have a **complete, production-ready Multi-Agent AI Travel Planning System** using CrewAI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and custom tool-calling.

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Create .env file with your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

## 🎯 What This System Does

**Input:**
```
"Plan a 10-day luxury honeymoon to Italy focusing on food and history.
We want to visit Rome and Florence, staying in 5-star hotels."
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Complete day-by-day itinerary
- ✅ Flight options with prices
- ✅ Hotel recommendations
- ✅ Activities and tours matched to interests
- ✅ Transportation logistics
- ✅ Cultural tips and advice
- ✅ Budget breakdown
- ✅ Pre-trip checklist

## 🤖 How It Works

**7 AI Agents Collaborate:**

1. **Travel Manager** - Analyzes your request
2. **Flight Agent** - Finds best flights
3. **Hotel Agent** - Finds perfect accommodations
4. **Activity Agent** - Curates experiences
5. **Logistics Agent** - Plans transportation
6. **Knowledge Agent** - Provides travel advice (using RAG!)
7. **Compiler Agent** - Creates final itinerary

**Technologies:**
- 🧠 **CrewAI** - Multi-agent orchestration
- 📚 **RAG** - ChromaDB vector database for knowledge retrieval
- 🛠️ **Custom Tools** - Flight, hotel, activity search
- 🤖 **OpenAI GPT-4** - Powering the agents

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (First Time)

1. Read this file (you're doing it!)
2. Read [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)
3. Run `python main.py`
4. See the magic happen!
5. Read [PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

### Intermediate (Ready to Customize)

1. Read [README.md](README.md)
2. Try different travel requests
3. Add your own travel documents to `data/travel_knowledge/`
4. Modify agents in [agents/agents.py](agents/agents.py)
5. Run `python test_tools.py` to test components

### Advanced (Ready to Build)

1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Study the tool implementations in [tools/](tools/)
3. Integrate real APIs (Amadeus, Booking.com, etc.)
4. Add new agents and capabilities
5. Build a web interface

## 🔑 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API Key** (get from https://platform.openai.com/)

That's all you need!

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### 1. Luxury Honeymoon
```
"Plan a 10-day luxury honeymoon to Italy focusing on food and history"
```

### 2. Solo Art Trip
```
"5-day trip to Paris for a solo traveler who loves art and food"
```

### 3. Family Vacation
```
"7-day family trip to Barcelona with kids - culture and beaches"
```

### 4. Your Custom Trip
```
Edit main.py and add your own request!
```

## 🛠️ What's Included
